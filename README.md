## Usage
The node_mudules are found of github but have been deleted for this submission. Version Control is also present and be seen in my repositories commit history in github.

## Code Style Guide
I have used JavaScript Standard as the code style to follow. I have used linters in the Atom file editor
to consistently implement the Style.

## Things to look for in code
1.I have a filter in place that censors any profanity as well as unwanted words like 'tea' (Ext 1).

2.I have implemented a map functionality to the map although it doesnt have all features on it (Ext 2).

3.All of the endpoints have been implemened and can be seen. (Development-only endpoints like reset and resample are not present in the code as the app user should never be able to access them).
